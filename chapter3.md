## How can I commit changes selectively?

```yaml

```

You don't have to put all of the changes you have made recently into the staging area at once.
For example,
suppose you are adding a feature to `analysis.R`
and spot a bug in `cleanup.R`.
After you have fixed it,
you want to save your work.
Since the changes to `cleanup.R` aren't directly related to the work you're doing in `analysis.R`,
you should save your work in two separate commits.

The syntax for staging a single file is `git add path/to/file`.

If you make a mistake and accidentally stage a file you shouldn't have, you can unstage the additions with `git reset HEAD` and try again.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
with open('dental/data/northern.csv', 'a') as writer:
    writer.write('2017-11-01,bicuspid\n')
with open('dental/data/eastern.csv', 'a') as writer:
    writer.write('2017-11-02,molar\n')
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('cd dental')
repl.run_command('git status')
```

From the output of `git status` on the right, you'll see that two files were changed; `data/northern.csv` and `data/eastern.csv`.
Stage only the changes made to `data/northern.csv`.

Use `git add` with a file path to stage the changes of this file.

```{shell}

## How do I re-stage files?

```

People often save their work every few minutes when they're using a desktop text editor.
Similarly,
it's common to use `git add` periodically
to save the most recent changes to a file to the staging area.
This is particularly useful when the changes are experimental
and you might want to undo them without cluttering up the repository's history.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
append = '''

Fehrenbach: "Dental Anatomy Coloring Book" (2e), 2013.

with open('dental/data/northern.csv', 'a') as writer:
    writer.write('2017-11-01,bicuspid\n')
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('cd dental')
repl.run_command('git add data/northern.csv')

## How can I undo changes to unstaged files?

```yaml
type: BulletConsoleExercise
key: 7ff1cc0a0e
xp: 100
```

Suppose you have made changes to a file,
then decide you want to **undo** them.
Your text editor may be able to do this,
but a more reliable way is to let Git do the work.
The command:

```
git checkout -- filename
```

will discard the changes that have not yet been staged.
(The double dash `--` must be there to separate the `git checkout` command
from the names of the file or files you want to recover.)

*Use this command carefully:*
once you discard changes in this way,
they are gone forever.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
with open('dental/data/northern.csv', 'a') as writer:
    writer.write('2017-11-01,bicuspid\n')
with open('dental/data/eastern.csv', 'a') as writer:
    writer.write('2017-11-02,molar\n')
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('cd dental')
repl.run_command('git add data/*.csv')
with open('dental/data/northern.csv', 'a') as writer:
    writer.write('2017-11-02,bicuspid\n')
repl.run_command('git status')
```

```yaml

`@instructions`
You are in the `dental` repository, where all changes to `.csv` files in `data` were staged.  `git status` shows that `data/northern.csv` was changed again after it was staged.

Use a Git command to undo the changes to the file `data/northern.csv`.

`@hint`
Use `git checkout` with `--` to separate the command from the name(s) of file(s),
and then the name(s) of file(s).

`@solution`
```{shell}
git checkout -- data/northern.csv

```

`@sct`
```{python}
msg = "After running your command, there should be no changes that can be staged. Have you used `git checkout` on `data/northern.csv` correctly? Make sure to use a `--` to separate the command from the name of the file."
Ex().multi(
    has_cwd('/home/repl/dental'),
    has_expr_output(expr='git diff --name-only | wc -w', output='0', incorrect_msg=msg)

## How can I undo changes to staged files?

```yaml
type: BulletConsoleExercise
key: fba584b9f1
xp: 100
```

At the start of this chapter you saw that `git reset` will unstage files that you previously staged using `git add`. By combining `git reset` with `git checkout`, you can undo changes to a file that you staged changes to. The syntax is as follows.

```
git reset HEAD path/to/file
git checkout -- path/to/file
```

(You may be wondering why there are two commands for re-setting changes.
The answer is that unstaging a file and undoing changes are both special cases
of more powerful Git operations that you have not yet seen.)

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

## How do I restore an old version of a file?

```yaml
type: BulletConsoleExercise
key: 61872a66b5
xp: 100
```

You previously saw how to use `git checkout` to undo the change that you made since the last commit. This command can also be used to go back even further into a file's history and restore versions of that file from a commit. In this way, you can think of committing as saving your work, and **checking out** as loading that saved version.

The syntax for restoring an old version takes two arguments: the hash that identifies the version you want to restore, and the name of the file.

For example, if `git log` shows this:

```
commit ab8883e8a6bfa873d44616a0f356125dbaccd9ea
Author: Author: Rep Loop <repl@datacamp.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 19 09:37:48 2017 -0400

    Adding graph to show latest quarterly results.

commit 2242bd761bbeafb9fc82e33aa5dad966adfe5409
Author: Author: Rep Loop <repl@datacamp.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 16 09:17:37 2017 -0400

    Modifying the bibliography format.
```

then `git checkout 2242bd report.txt` would replace the current version of `report.txt` with the version that was committed on October 16. Notice that this is the same syntax that you used to undo the unstaged changes, except `--` has been replaced by a hash.

Restoring a file doesn't erase any of the repository's history.
Instead, the act of restoring the file is saved as another commit, because you might later want to undo your undoing.

One more thing: there's another feature of `git log` that will come in handy here. Passing `-` then a number restricts the output to that many commits. For example, `git log -3 report.txt` shows you the last three commits involving `report.txt`.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('cd dental')

## How can I undo all of the changes I have made?

```yaml
type: BulletConsoleExercise
key: d45eca9a34
xp: 100
```

So far, you have seen how to undo changes to a single file at a time using `git reset HEAD path/to/file`.
You will sometimes want to undo changes to many files.


One way to do this is to give `git reset` a directory. For example, `git reset HEAD data` will unstage any files from the `data` directory. Even better, if you don't provide any files or directories, it will unstage everything. Even even better, `HEAD` is the default commit to unstage, so you can simply write `git reset` to unstage everything.

Similarly `git checkout -- data` will then restore the files in the `data` directory to their previous state. You can't leave the file argument completely blank, but recall from [Introduction to Shell for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell-for-data-science) that you can refer to the current directory as `.`. So `git checkout -- .` will revert all files in the current directory.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
with open('dental/data/northern.csv', 'a') as writer:
    writer.write('2017-11-01,bicuspid\n')
with open('dental/data/eastern.csv', 'a') as writer:
    writer.write('2017-11-02,molar\n')
with open('dental/report.txt', 'a') as writer:
    writer.write('\n(Because funding is the most important part of any project.)\n')
