## What is a branch?

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
key: 9db055a148
lang: bash
xp: 50
```

If you don't use version control, a common workflow is to create different subdirectories to hold different versions of your project in different states, for example `development` and `final`. Of course, then you always end up with `final-updated` and `final-updated-revised` as well. The problem with this is that it becomes difficult to work out if you have the right version of each file in the right subdirectory, and you risk losing work.

One of the reasons Git is popular is its support for creating **branches**, which allows you to have multiple versions of your work, and lets you track each version systematically.

Each branch is like a parallel universe: changes you make in one branch do not affect other branches (until you **merge** them back together).

Note:
Chapter 2 described the three-part data structure Git uses to record a repository's history:
*blobs* for files,
*trees* for the saved states of the repositories,
and *commits* to record the changes.
Branches are the reason Git needs both trees and commits:
a commit will have two parents when branches are being merged.

<hr>

In the diagram below, each box is a commit and the arrows point to the next ("child") commit.
How many merges have taken place?

`@hint`
Look for boxes with two arrows coming into them.

`@possible_answers`
- None
- 1
- [2]
- 3

`@feedback`
- No: some commits have more than one parent.
- No: some commits have more than one parent.
- Correct: two commits have more than one parent.
- No: only two commits have more than one parent.

## How can I see what branches my repository has?

```yaml
type: MultipleChoiceExercise
key: f48d0ea4cf
lang: shell
xp: 50
skills: 1
```

By default,
every Git repository has a branch called `master`
(which is why you have been seeing that word in Git's output in previous lessons).
To list all of the branches in a repository,
you can run the command `git branch`.
The branch you are currently in will be shown with a `*` beside its name.

<hr>

You are in the `dental` repository.
How many branches are in this repository (including `master`)?

`@possible_answers`
- None.
- 1.
- 2.
- 3.

`@hint`
Use `git branch` to list branches.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{shell}
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('cd dental')
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().has_chosen(4, ['No: every repository has at least one branch.',
                    'No: there are more branches than that.',
                    'No: there are more branches than that.',
                    'Correct!'])
```

## How can I view the differences between branches?

```yaml
type: MultipleChoiceExercise
key: 7333c66616
lang: shell
xp: 50
skills: 1
```

Branches and revisions are closely connected,
and commands that work on the latter usually work on the former.
For example,
just as `git diff revision-1..revision-2` shows the difference between two versions of a repository,
`git diff branch-1..branch-2` shows the difference between two branches.

<hr>

You are in the `dental` repository.
How many files in the `summary-statistics` branch
are different from their equivalents in the `master` branch?

`@possible_answers`
- None.
- 1.
- 3.
- 8.

`@hint`
Use `git diff branch..branch` to find the differences.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{shell}
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('cd dental')
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().has_chosen(3, ['No: some files differ.',
                    'No: please count both files that have changed and files that are being added.',
                    'Correct!',
                    'No: please count the number of files that differ, not the number of lines that are different.'])
```

## How can I switch from one branch to another?

```yaml
type: BulletConsoleExercise
key: c418145d13
xp: 100
```

You previously used `git checkout` with a commit hash to switch the repository state to that hash. You can also use `git checkout` with the name of a branch to switch to that branch.

Two notes: 

1. When you run `git branch`, it puts a `*` beside the name of the branch you are currently in. 
2. Git will only let you do this if all of your changes have been committed. You can get around this, but it is outside the scope of this course.

In this exercise, you'll also make use of `git rm`. This removes the file (just like the shell command `rm`) then stages the removal of that file with `git add`, all in one step.

repl = connect('bash')

## How can I create a branch?

```yaml
type: BulletConsoleExercise
key: 51c4cb1dc0
xp: 100
```

You might expect that you would use `git branch` to create a branch, and indeed this is possible. However, the most common thing you want to do is to create a branch then switch to that branch.

In the previous exercise, you used `git checkout branch-name` to switch to a branch. To create a branch then switch to it in one step, you add a `-b` flag, calling `git checkout -b branch-name`,

The contents of the new branch are initially identical to the contents of the original.
Once you start making changes,
they only affect the new branch.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('cd dental')

```{shell}
git checkout -b deleting-report

## How can I merge two branches?

```yaml
type: BulletConsoleExercise
key: 3812382b52
xp: 100
```

Branching lets you create parallel universes;
**merging** is how you bring them back together.
When you merge one branch (call it the source) into another (call it the destination),
Git incorporates the changes made to the source branch into the destination branch.
If those changes don't overlap,
the result is a new commit in the destination branch that includes everything from the source branch.
(The next exercises describes what happens if there *are* conflicts.)

To merge two branches,
you run `git merge source destination`
(without `..` between the two branch names).
Git automatically opens an editor so that you can write a log message for the merge;
you can either keep its default message or fill in something more informative.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('cd dental')
```

```yaml

You are in the `master` branch of the `dental` repository.

Use `git merge` with `summary-statistics` as the first argument (the "from" branch)
and `master` as the second (the "to" branch).

`@solution`
```{shell}
# Run this command *without* the '-no-edit' flag:

## What are conflicts?

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
key: 354f733f81
lang: bash
xp: 50
```

Sometimes the changes in two branches will conflict with each other:
for example,
bug fixes might touch the same lines of code,
or analyses in two different branches may both append new (and different) records
to a summary data file.
In this case,
Git relies on you to reconcile the conflicting changes.

<hr>

The file `todo.txt` initially contains these two lines:

```
A) Write report.
B) Submit report.
```

You create a branch called `update` and modify the file to be:

```
A) Write report.
B) Submit final version.
C) Submit expenses.
```

You then switch back to the `master` branch and delete the first line,
so that the file contains:

```
B) Submit report.
```

When you try to merge `update` and `master`,
what conflicts does Git report?

`@hint`
Look for lines with `+` or `-` in front of them.

`@possible_answers`
- [Just line B, since it is the only one to change in both branches.]
- Lines A and B, since one was deleted and the other changed.
- Lines B and C, since one was changed and the other deleted.
- All three lines, since all were either added, deleted, or changed.

`@feedback`
- Correct: Git can merge the deletion of line A and the addition of line C automatically.
- No: Git can merge the deletion of line A automatically.
- No: Git can merge the addition of line C automatically.
- No: Git can merge the deletion of line A and the addition of line C automatically.

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## How can I merge two branches with conflicts?

```yaml
type: BulletConsoleExercise
key: 3a4ba0eda1
xp: 100
```

When there is a conflict during a merge,
Git tells you that there's a problem,
and running `git status` after the merge
reminds you which files have conflicts that you need to resolve
by printing `both modified:` beside the files' names.

Inside the file,
Git leaves markers that look like this to tell you where the conflicts occurred:

```
<<<<<<< destination-branch-name
...changes from the destination branch...
=======
...changes from the source branch...
>>>>>>> source-branch-name
```

(In many cases,
the destination branch name will be `HEAD`,
because you will be merging into the current branch.)
To resolve the conflict,
edit the file to remove the markers
and make whatever other changes are needed to reconcile the changes,
then commit those changes.

repl = connect('bash')
