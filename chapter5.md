## How can I create a brand new repository?

```yaml
type: ConsoleExercise

```

So far,
you have been working with repositories that we created.
If you want to create a repository for a new project,
you can simply say `git init project-name`,
where "project-name" is the name you want the new repository's root directory to have.

One thing you should *not* do is create one Git repository inside another.
While Git does allow this,
updating **nested repositories** becomes very complicated very quickly,
since you need to tell Git which of the two `.git` directories the update is to be stored in.
Very large projects occasionally need to do this,
but most programmers and data analysts try to avoid getting into this situation.

`@instructions`
Use a single command to create a new Git repository called `optical` below your home directory.

`@hint`
Call `git init`, passing the name of the repository to be created.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}

```

`@solution`
```{shell}
git init optical
```

`@sct`
```{python}
msgpatt = "There is no folder %s in %s. Have you used `git init optical` appropriately to create a new Git repository?"
Ex().multi(
    has_cwd('/home/repl'),
    has_dir('/home/repl/optical', incorrect_msg=msgpatt % ('`optical`', '`/home/repl`')),
    has_dir('/home/repl/optical/.git', incorrect_msg=msgpatt % ('`.git`', 'the `optical` folder'))
)
Ex().success_msg("Well done! This was starting from scratch, but you'll often want to turn an existing folder into a Git repo as well. Find out how in the next exercise.")
```

Experienced Git users instinctively start new projects by creating repositories.
If you are new to Git,
though,
or working with people who are,
you will often want to convert existing projects into repositories.
Doing so is simple:
just run

```
git init
```

in the project's root directory, or 

```
git init /path/to/project
```

from anywhere else on your computer.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('cd dental')
repl.run_command('rm -rf .git')
repl.run_command('clear')
repl.run_command('pwd')
```

***

```yaml
type: ConsoleExercise
key: 101686c0e7
xp: 50
```

`@instructions`
You are in the directory `dental`,
which is not yet a Git repository.
Use a single command to convert it to a Git repository.

`@hint`
Use `git init` with no arguments.

`@solution`
```{shell}
git init

```

`@sct`
```{python}
msg = "There is no `.git` folder in `dental`. Are you sure you used `git init` correctly?"
Ex().multi(
    has_cwd('/home/repl/dental'),
    has_dir('/home/repl/dental/.git', incorrect_msg=msg)
)

```

***

```yaml
type: ConsoleExercise
key: e65f050907
xp: 50
```

`@instructions`
Check the status of your new repository.

`@hint`
As always, use `git status`.

`@solution`
```{shell}
git status

```

`@sct`
```{python}
msg="Have you used `git status` to look at the status of your freshly initialized repository?"
Ex().multi(
    has_cwd('/home/repl/dental'),
    check_correct(
        has_expr_output(),
        has_code(r'\s*git\s+status\s*', incorrect_msg = msg)
    )
)
Ex().success_msg("Interesting: after initializing the folder into a repository, Git immediately notices that there are a bunch of changes that can be staged (and afterwards, committed).")

## How can I create a copy of an existing repository?

```yaml
type: BulletConsoleExercise
key: 9fb3b2ed49
xp: 100
```

Sometimes you will join a project that is already running,
inherit a project from someone else,
or continue working on one of your own projects on a new machine.
In each case,
you will **clone** an existing repository instead of creating a new one.
Cloning a repository does exactly what the name suggests:
it creates a copy of an existing repository (including all of its history) in a new directory.

To clone a repository,
use the command `git clone URL`,
where `URL` identifies the repository you want to clone.
This will normally be something like 

```
https://github.com/datacamp/project.git
```

but for this lesson,
we will use a repository on the local file system, so you can just use a path to that directory.

When you clone a repository,
Git uses the name of the existing repository as the name of the clone's root directory:
for example,

```
git clone /existing/project
```

will create a new directory called `project`.
If you want to call the clone something else,
add the directory name you want to the command:

```
git clone /existing/project newprojectname
```

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('rm -rf dental')
repl.run_command('clear')
repl.run_command('pwd')
repl.run_command('ls')
```

***

```yaml
type: ConsoleExercise
key: 2b06ff535f
xp: 100
```

`@instructions`
You have just inherited the dental data analysis project from a colleague,
who tells you that all of their work is in a repository in `/home/thunk/repo`.
Use a single command to clone this repository
to create a new repository called `dental` inside your home directory
(so that the new repository is in `/home/repl/dental`).

`@hint`
Call `git clone`, passing the absolute path the the existing repository, and the name for the new repository.

`@solution`
```{shell}
git clone /home/thunk/repo dental

```

`@sct`
```{python}
msgpatt = "There is no folder %s in %s. Have you used `git clone` with the original repository location and the new name?"
Ex().multi(
    has_cwd('/home/repl'),
    has_dir('/home/repl/dental', incorrect_msg=msgpatt % ('`dental`', '`/home/repl`')),
    has_dir('/home/repl/dental/.git', incorrect_msg=msgpatt % ('`.git`', 'the `dental` folder'))
)
Ex().success_msg("Well done! Let's continue!")

```

## How can I find out where a cloned repository originated?

```yaml
type: MultipleChoiceExercise
key: 61567f27d4
lang: shell
xp: 50
skills: 1
```

When you a clone a repository,
Git remembers where the original repository was.
It does this by storing a **remote** in the new repository's configuration.
A remote is like a browser bookmark with a name and a URL.

If you use an online git repository hosting service like GitHub or Bitbucket, a common task would be that you clone a repository from that site to work locally on your computer. Then the copy on the website is the remote.

If you are in a repository,
you can list the names of its remotes using `git remote`.

If you want more information, you can use `git remote -v` (for "verbose"),
which shows the remote's URLs.
Note that "URLs" is plural:
it's possible for a remote to have several URLs associated with it for different purposes,
though in practice each remote is almost always paired with just one URL.

<hr>

You are in the `dental` repository.
How many remotes does it have?

`@possible_answers`
- None.
- 1.
- 2.

`@hint`
Run `git remote` in the `dental` repository.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{shell}
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('rm -rf dental')
repl.run_command('git clone /home/thunk/repo dental')
repl.run_command('clear')
repl.run_command('cd dental')
```

`@sct`
```{python}
Ex().has_chosen(2, ['No: Look at the output from `git remote`.',
                    'Correct!',
                    'No: there is just one remote, but it has several URLs.'])
```

---

## How can I define remotes?

```yaml
type: BulletConsoleExercise
key: 1e327efda1
xp: 100
```

When you clone a repository,
Git automatically creates a remote called `origin`
that points to the original repository.
You can add more remotes using:

```
git remote add remote-name URL
```

and remove existing ones using:

```
git remote rm remote-name
```

You can connect any two Git repositories this way,
but in practice,
you will almost always connect repositories that share some common ancestry.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('cd dental')
```

***

```yaml
type: ConsoleExercise
key: a0e2cf2d0f
xp: 100
```

`@instructions`
You are in the `dental` repository.
Add `/home/thunk/repo` as a remote called `thunk` to it.

`@hint`
Be sure to count the slashes properly in the remote URL.

`@solution`
```{shell}
git remote add thunk /home/thunk/repo

```

`@sct`
```{python}
msg1="The system couldn't find a remote with the name `thunk`. Have you used `git remote add thunk <path_to_remote>`?"
msg2="Are you sure the path of the thunk remote is correct? Have you used `git remote add thunk /home/thunk/repo`?"
Ex().multi(
    has_cwd('/home/repl/dental'),
    has_expr_output('git remote', output='thunk', strict=True, incorrect_msg=msg1),
    check_or(
        has_expr_output(
            'git remote get-url thunk',
             output='/home/thunk/repo', strict=True, incorrect_msg=msg2
        ),
        has_expr_output(
            'git remote get-url thunk',
             output='file:///home/thunk/repo', strict=True, incorrect_msg=msg2
        )
    )
)
Ex().success_msg("Neat! Now you added a remote to your local git repository.")

## How can I pull in changes from a remote repository?

```yaml
type: BulletConsoleExercise
key: 4d5be24350
xp: 100
```

Git keeps track of remote repositories so that you can
**pull** changes from those repositories
and **push** changes to them.

Recall that the remote repository is often a repository in an online hosting service like GitHub. A typical workflow is that you pull in your collaborators' work from the remote repository so you have the latest version of everything, do some work yourself, then push your work back to the remote so that your collaborators have access to it.

Pulling changes is straightforward:
the command `git pull remote branch`
gets everything in `branch` in the remote repository identified by `remote`
and merges it into the current branch of your local repository.
For example,
if you are in the `quarterly-report` branch of your local repository,
the command:

```
git pull thunk latest-analysis
```

would get changes from `latest-analysis` branch
in the repository associated with the remote called `thunk`
and merge them into your `quarterly-report` branch.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('rm -rf dental')
repl.run_command('git clone /home/thunk/repo dental')
repl.run_command('git -C dental reset --hard HEAD~2')
repl.run_command('clear')
repl.run_command('cd dental')
```

***

```yaml
type: ConsoleExercise
key: cb79240464
xp: 100
```

`@instructions`
You are in the `master` branch of the repository `dental`. Pull the changes from the `master` branch of the remote repository called `origin`.

`@hint`
Use `git pull` with the name of the remote (`origin`) and the name of the branch (`master`).

`@solution`
```{shell}
git pull origin master

```

`@sct`
```{python}
msg1 = "Make sure you are on the `master` branch (use `git checkout master` to switch to it)."
msg2 = "If you correctly called `git pull origin master`, the last commit on the `master` should be one from the remote, but it turns out that's not the case. Try again."
Ex().multi(
    has_cwd('/home/repl/dental'),
    has_expr_output(expr='git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD | grep master',
                    output='master', strict=True, incorrect_msg=msg1),
    has_expr_output(expr = "git log -1 --pretty=%B | grep Reminder", output="Reminder to add references to report.", strict=True,
                    incorrect_msg=msg2)
)
Ex().success_msg("Well done! This `git pull` went smoothly, but unfortunately that's not always the case. Let's see what can happen if you have unsaved changes when trying to pull in changes.")

```

## What happens if I try to pull when I have unsaved changes?

```yaml

```

Just as Git stops you from switching branches when you have unsaved work,
it also stops you from pulling in changes from a remote repository
when doing so might overwrite things you have done locally.
The fix is simple:
either commit your local changes or revert them,
and then try to pull again.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('rm -rf dental')
repl.run_command('git clone /home/thunk/repo dental')

## How can I push my changes to a remote repository?

```yaml

```

The complement of `git pull` is `git push`,
which pushes the changes you have made locally into a remote repository.
The most common way to use it is:

```
git push remote-name branch-name
```

which pushes the contents of your branch `branch-name`
into a branch with the same name
in the remote repository associated with `remote-name`.
It's possible to use different branch names at your end and the remote's end,
but doing this quickly becomes confusing:
it's almost always better to use the same names for branches across repositories.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{python}
repl = connect('bash')
repl.run_command('rm -rf dental')
repl.run_command('git clone /home/thunk/repo dental')
